There are three base types of nodes: Supplier - provides data, e.g. listens on an HTTP port or reads a file. Consumer - received data and does something with it. E.g. writes to a file or sends an HTTP response. Function - produces output data from input data. Function is both a supplier and a consumer. In the above diagram: The supplier listens for HTTP requests, parses them and passes to the query database function The query database function uses the request data to retrieve information from a database and passes query results to the rendering function The rendering function generates response HTML The send response consumer sends the rendered response back There are many technology solutions doing similar things. However, many of them are built for specific target runtimes. The goal of this model to be runtime-agnostic, which allows modelers to focus on the &ldquo;business&rdquo; flow using terminology specific to their semantic domain. For example, &ldquo;book a flight&rdquo;. During modeling it should be irrelevant how a flight is booked - by making a REST call, sending a JMS message or adding a record to a database. Making such decisions during modeling might be premature and inefficient because it distracts from the primary goal - modeling a flow1. Even in the above rather low-level flow there are multiple variation points - there are different ways to listen for HTTP request, many different databases and ways to query them, &hellip; The following sections provide an overview of the model elements, explain how to map Drawio diagrams to this model, and provide some guidelines regarding generators. Summary Drawio mapping condition configuration errors implementation String Map input order output source target-input target-output Generation Interpretation Flow inheritance Usage scenario Summary As it was mentioned at the beginning, there are three base types of model elements - suppliers, consumers, and functions. A function is both a supplier and a consumer. Flow element is a base class for other model elements. Flow is a container of flow elements with several flavors - just a flow (command), supplier flow, function flow , and consumer flow. Suppliers, functions, and consumers communicate via transitions and calls. Error transitions are activated in case of errors. There are three flow element types which don&rsquo;t use transitions to communicate: Error handler - activated by errors which were not handled by error transitions. Publisher - publishes its inputs to subscribers. Subscriber - receives inputs from publishers. Start and End are flow input/output &ldquo;ports&rdquo; passing data from the flow to its elements. There is a number of source flavors of the above elements which allow to associates some type of source code with an element. The classifiers table lists all model elements alphabetically with short descriptions. The UML diagram shows model element relationships and attributes. There are also several types of graph representations including: Force graph Force graph with dependencies Drawio mapping Mapping of Drawio diagrams to Ecore models is explained in detail in the Beyond Diagrams book. This section documents diagram element properties specific for the function flow model. All properties below except order support -ref suffix to load them from an external resource resolved relative to the element&rsquo;s base-uri. For example, input property specifies input type, input-ref specifies a URI of a resource containing input type specification. The mapping logic just loads the below properties, what to do with them is up to the generation/execution logic. As such, the below sections are guidelines/suggestions which might be followed, extended, or ignored by the generator/interpreter providers. condition A condition for transitions, publishers, and subscribers. For generators it might be a boolean expression in the target language or a method body evaluating to boolean value. For a Java interpreter it might be a SpEL expression. configuration Element configuration. E.g. YAML configuration. errors A list of error types thrown by a given element. Similar to Java method throws clause. Errors value is loaded as YAML and if it is a list (array) then its elements are treated as error type specifications. Otherwise, the entire value it treated as a single error type specification. A type specification for errors, input, and output can be: String Logical name, e.g. Account Physical name, e.g. mypackage.Account Map (YAML, JSON, XML, &hellip;) Type specification (schema) Mapping of argument names to argument types - logical, physical, specifications Maven coordinates to add to dependencies or construct a classloader + type name implementation Flow element implementation specification to be used by a generator or an interpreter/executor. Below are a few suggestions for implementation format: String A logical or a physical name of implementation class/object which can be instantiated or looked up in some registry. For example in Java: http-listener - a logical name to be translated to an object by the generator. mypackage.HttpListener - service interface name. Service implementations are to be loaded by ServiceLoader mypackage.HttpListenerImpl - implementation class name to be instantiated. The string may also include Maven coordinates e.g. mypackage.HttpListenerImpl@my-group:my-artifact:my-version. Map A map in YAML, JSON, properties, XML, or other format may specify: Maven coordinates to add to dependencies in a generated pom.xml file or to create a classloader. Implementation class or service interface name. Configuration parameters as an alternative or addition to configuration input Input type for consumers, functions, and transitions. order Condition evaluation and type matching order for transitions. output Output type for suppliers, functions, and transitions. source Source code. Generators can copy it to the generated classes or use as a template (E.g. Apache FreeMarker or Mustache.java) to generate code. Interpreters may executed code. In Java interpreters may use scripting to evaluate source code. For example GraalVM ScriptEngine. target-input Input type for a call target. Defaults to the call input type if blank. target-output Output type for a call target. Defaults to the call output type if blank. Generation A generator for Java target may: Generate a single input parameter for consumers and functions Generate a list of parameters from maps Add context parameter to allow flow elements to set/get shared flow state and lookup services. E.g. Context or MutableContext. Add progress monitor parameter Reuse flow elements for multiple inputs or create a new instance of the top-level flow for every input, or use a pool of instances. Merge generated code with existing code preserving manual modifications. This would allow to have evolve the flow/implementations, flow configuration, and generated code in parallel and then merge the three lines of evolution. E.g. upgrade to a new flow version or change implementation or configuration for a flow element. Generation and merging can be done using the Java model. Generate suppliers, functions, and consumers as SupplierFactory, FunctionFactory, and ConsumerFactory respectively Generate multiple code flavors. For example, a simple synchronous flavor, which is easy to trace and debug, and reactive streams implementation for non-blocking asynchronous processing. Generate a compute (processors) graph. This can be done by an interpreter as well. Transitions might be generated as communication channels, e.g. Netty channels. It would allow to have multiple options to distribute generated code to processing nodes such as cloud VM&rsquo;s. This could possibly be combined with reactive code generation by leveraging Reactor Netty. Interpretation TODO - explain createFunction() and createProcessor() (from Graph) In Java an interpreter may use SpEL expressions for conditions, scripting to evaluate sources and Maven classloader to load implementations. It may pass progress monitor and context variables between flow elements. Flow inheritance Flow elements have unique id&rsquo;s. This allows to implement flow inheritance - overriding configuration of a base flow. Currently this functionality is not part of the model - it can be implemented by generators and interpreters. Usage scenario A flow is created in terms of the semantic domain. E.g. Enroll student to a class. Flows and elements are documented and documentation is published to be available to stakeholders. Flows may define actors and flow elements may define roles and actors in roles to assign responsibilities. Flows and flow elements may have a single or multiple implementations as well as multiple sets of configuration properties. This allows to have a multiple embodiments of the same flow for different use cases. Implementations may be bespoke or reusable. Diagram elements mapped to reusable implementations may be distributed as custom libraries2. Flows can form a hierarchy and flow element implementations can be flows or generated from flows.
